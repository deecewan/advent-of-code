Challenges from the 'Advent of Code' 2015.
I've tried to use an assortment of languages, but at this early stage, I'll assume they'll all be done in either Javascript or Python.
I might get tricky and try and do one or two in PHP.

I'd like to attempt some in Ruby, too, just to get a feel.

So this Repo is just a massive bag of code challenges from http://adventofcode.com/ in no particular language or level of skill.

I *have* tried to use shorthand for stuff when possible (Ternaries, Python One-Liners, etc.), but I'd like to be able to read this one day in the future.


I used their free IDE, so I figured I'd leave this here as a sponsorship.
